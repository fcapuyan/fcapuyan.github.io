            Contract 
        </h2>
        <p> 
            I, Jacob M. Capuyan agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2026, ITIS- 3135, Front-End Web Application  with my instructor, 
            Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online 
            tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that
            I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ 
            code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) 
            and never from my classmates. Signed: Jacob M. Capuyan, DD/MM/YYYY
